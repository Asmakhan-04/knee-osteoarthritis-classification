# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Classification
# Knee Osteoarthritis Classification using CNN

This project focuses on detecting and classifying **Knee Osteoarthritis (OA)** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to assist early diagnosis of OA from X-ray images by automating the classification process through deep learning.

## Objective

To build a deep learning model that can classify the severity of knee osteoarthritis from radiographic images using CNN architectures. This assists in faster diagnosis and improved treatment planning.

## Dataset

- Dataset Source: [Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)](https://nda.nih.gov/oai/)
- Contains knee X-ray images with graded severity levels (e.g., KL Grades 0â€“4)

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Workflow

1. Load and preprocess knee X-ray image dataset
2. Normalize and resize images
3. Split into training and testing sets
4. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
5. Train the model on labeled OA images
6. Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Model Architecture

- Convolution + ReLU
- MaxPooling
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully connected layers
- Softmax output for multi-class classification

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Loss/Accuracy Curves

## Sample Output

- Example predictions on unseen test X-ray images
- Model performance graph

## Applications

- Early detection of degenerative joint disease
- Helps radiologists reduce diagnosis time
- Clinical decision support

## Future Improvements

- Integrate with a user interface for uploading images
- Use pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Class activation maps (CAM) for interpretability
